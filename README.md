# CTFBrowsingMonitor

A browser activity tracker for the CTF Resource Use research project at Tufts Security and Privacy Lab. The extension collects the urls visited, the percentages of webpages viewed by users, and the time stamps on each visit. There will also be a short survey asking questions about the webpage just viewed for non-search engine urls. Participants will be needing this tool to participate in the study.
